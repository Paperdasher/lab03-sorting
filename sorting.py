## Lab03- Sorting ##


# In this lab, you will be writing three different sorting methods. 
# The three algorithms are selection sort, a bubble sort, and a insertion sort.
# Although there are not good algorithms to sort a list, they serve as a good educational purpose to understand list structure.

# Bubble Sort

# This is the most basic sorting method. 
# From the left side, if the current element is greater than the next element, swap them. 
# If not, leave as is. 
# Continue this process until the list is sorted.
